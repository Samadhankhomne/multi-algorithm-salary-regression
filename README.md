# multi-algorithm-salary-regression
This project focuses on predicting employee salaries using various regression techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Polynomial Regression.
The models are compared based on key performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and accuracy. 
The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results, providing insights into which algorithm delivers the best prediction accuracy for employee salaries
